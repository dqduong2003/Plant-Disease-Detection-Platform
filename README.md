# Plant-Disease-Detection-Platform
Plant disease prediction model created using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It is built using VGG16 pre-trained model.\
<b>Validation Accuracy: 96%</b>\

## To run the model:
1. Go to anaconda terminal and install tensorflow library
```
pip install tensorflow
```
2. Run everything EXCEPT second code block (Prepare the dataset). It was used to split the image folders to training and validation.
